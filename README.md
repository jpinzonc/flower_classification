# Flower Classification Based on Images
## PURPOSE:
To generate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using pytorch to classify flowers from images

## DESCRIPTION:
This is my Project for the Udacity pytorch Challenge 2018 program I was part of. 

## USAGE:
Download the notebook, start jupyter (notebook or lab), open the notebook, and run each cell. 
You will need the auxiliary files too.
